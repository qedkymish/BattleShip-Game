# Battleship Game
C++ implementation of the classic Battleship game. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create an interactive and strategic gameplay experience. The game includes a 10x10 board, various ship classes, and a system for random ship placement and validation.

# Features:
1. 10x10 Game Board: Visual representation of the game state, including ship positions and player actions.
2. Ship Classes: Includes five different ship classesâ€”Frigate, Submarine, Destroyer, Battleship, and Aircraft Carrier, each with unique attributes.
3. Random Ship Placement: Ships are placed randomly on the board, with validation to prevent overlapping and out-of-bounds placement.
4. Object-Oriented Design: Encapsulates ship behavior, board management, and game logic using C++ classes and polymorphism.
# Purpose:
This project focuses on applying OOP concepts to implement a turn-based strategy game, enhancing understanding of class interactions, randomization, and game development.
